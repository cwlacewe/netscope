# Netscope CNN Analyzer

available here: http://dgschwend.github.io/netscope 

This is a CNN Analyzer tool, based on Netscope by [ethereon](https://github.com/ethereon).
Netscope is a web-based tool for visualizing neural network topologies. It currently supports UC Berkeley's [Caffe framework](https://github.com/bvlc/caffe).

This fork adds analysis capabilities, enabling the computation of network complexity (number of operations) and network size (number of parameters) for easy comparison of different networks.
